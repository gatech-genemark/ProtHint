To install, copy the content of distribution to desired location.
The following dependencies need to be satisfied:

#------------------------------------
1. PERL DEPENDENCIES

   MCE::Mutex
   threads
   YAML

#------------------------------------
2. PYTHON

3. GENEMARK-ES

There are two ways of using GeneMark-ES:

    a. Run ProtHint with "--geneMarkGtf genemark.gtf" option which specifies the path
    to a file with GeneMark-ES predictions. If this option is used, GeneMark-ES does not 
    need to be installed.

    b. Install GeneMark-ES, ProtHint will run it automatically as a part of the pipeline:

    Download and extract the contents of the GeneMark-ES suite (versions 4.30 and up) into
    the ProtHint/dependencies/GeneMarkES folder.

    GeneMark-ES suite is available at http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/license_download.cgi

    To check that all the required Perl CPAN modules for ES are installed on your system,
    run GeneMark-ES without parameters:

    ProtHint/dependencies/GeneMarkES/bin/gmes_petap.pl

    If the command outputs usage information, then all the required Perl modules are installed.
