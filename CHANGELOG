# Changelog

## [2.1.1] 2019-7-11

- Added the option to run final alignment with ProSplign
    - Spaln is still used to pre-select proteins for alignment, as a speed-up

## [2.1.0] 2019-7-11

- Improved filtering of high confidence starts

## [2.0.0] 2019-7-5

### Major changes

- Output is now directly parsed and filtered from Spaln, ProSplign step is omitted
    - This change significantly improves the runtime (3x-20x speedup depending on 
      the genome size)
- Improved sensitivity of all reported hints (in prothint.gff file) due to changes
  in the filtering procedure, especially for very remote proteins
 
### Other changes

- Added usage example
- Added printing of progress messages
- Added a cleanup option
