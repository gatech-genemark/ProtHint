# Changelog

## [2.3.0] 2020-1-3

### Major changes

- Updated the default maximum number of target proteins which are spliced
  aligned per seed gene
    - Changed from 250 to 25 based on the observation that using more than 25
      protein targets does not lead to a significant increase in sensitivity
      of hints
    - The change leads to ~10x faster runtime
- The default filtering thresholds for High-Confidence hints were updated to
  accommodate for the change in the maximum number of target proteins
- Transition from Python 2 to Python 3

### Other changes

- Refactored code for system and dependency calls
    - Check whether system/dependency call finished successfully
    - If a dependency is not found in the `dependency` folder, ProtHint looks
      for the dependency in the `PATH`
- Added output with chained hints corresponding to the best aligned protein
  per gene seeds -- this output is used by [Augustus](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus)
  in [BRAKER](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER)

## [2.2.0] 2019-10-11

### Major changes

- Bug fix: Frameshifts are no longer reported as introns in the output

### Other changes

- Reorganized project structure: Spaln and ProSplign alignment scorers were
  moved to separate repositories
- Improved installation and run instructions

## [2.1.1] 2019-7-11

- Added the option to run final alignment with ProSplign
    - Spaln is still used to pre-select proteins for alignment, as a speed-up

## [2.1.0] 2019-7-11

- Improved filtering of high confidence starts

## [2.0.0] 2019-7-5

### Major changes

- Output is now directly parsed and filtered from Spaln, ProSplign step is omitted
    - This change significantly improves the runtime (3x-20x speedup depending on 
      the genome size)
- Improved sensitivity of all reported hints (in prothint.gff file) due to changes
  in the filtering procedure, especially for very remote proteins
 
### Other changes

- Added usage example
- Added printing of progress messages
- Added a cleanup option
